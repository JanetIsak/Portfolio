    <p>My first week at <em>Moringa School</em> has been an amazing experience. I have created more than three beginners html web pages and to list some:</p>
      <div class="basic">
        <ul>
          <li class="basic"><strong>Hello world</strong></li>
            <p>This was the first html I created with the basic html structures only and no website designs has been added. check out <a href="file:///home/isak/Documents/hello-world/hello-world.html">Hello world</a> to view the website.</p>
          <li class="basic"><strong>Happy travel</strong></li>
            <p>This was the last website for my first week. I used the html basic structures together with the css styles to add colors, font-style and image. Check out <a href="file:///home/isak/Documents/Happy-Trails-Travel-Agency/travel.html">Happy trails.</a></p>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a person who likes participating in different area of expertise. I have always tried to learn and do things whenever I have the chance and I am a fast learner. I also like sharing my talent and education freely by teaching others who are interested to learn. My field of interest mainly lies in the marketing aspects of business companies and tourism services. Besides, the world globalising so fast and almost everything being done online, this interest and curiousity dragged me to study programming to make my life easier in digital marketing.
